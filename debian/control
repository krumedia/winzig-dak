Description: Partial and leightweight reimplementation of dak
 This is winzig-dak a fork of mini-dak.
 .
 Both a partial and lightweight reimplementation of dak (Debian Archive Kit)
 in shell script and with no database dependencies, "designed" to host small
 Debian repositories.
 .
 So the main purpose of mini-dak is to run a slave archive for new Debian ports,
 taking all sources from the master archive. Source uploads to the slave archive
 are supposed to be modifications and porting fixes for the new architectures.
 .
 winzig-dak uses this leightweight implementation, but can be used to share
 packages in addition to the official repositories.
